spec
====

Instead of having testgen produce test code directly, which other
components (like `split-testgen`) then have to parse, make test
generators produce a JSON database of test code and have something to
convert this to C source (possible splitting it).  This will also
enable us to display test code in the viewer.

Sequential testing mode. Check that the model and implementation agree
by running all individual operations.  This should probably also cover
operations that never appear in a commutative context.

Introspecting on spec's behavior to visualize the symbolic execution
plan was a mess.  Try to make spec more modular so it can be used by a
visualizer without having to hack the visualizer directly into
simsym/spec.  Perhaps make the model driver general purpose, move it
out into a module, and use something like the TestWriter interface to
register hooks into it.


fs_testgen
==========

Have a fs_testgen-specific C source file that must be compiled along
with its output test code, rather than putting function definitions in
giant Python strings or awkwardly in headers.  Pull
fs_testgen-specific stuff out of the fstest headers.

Pull all setup tasks into common functions, rather than open-coding
them in every setup function.


fstest
======

Currently specialized to testing operating systems, but it's not far
from being able to test other interfaces.

fstest is fairly specific to fs_testgen right now, which limits the
re-usability of the whole Commuter pipeline.  Make fstest more general
purpose.

Make fstest support more than pairs.

We could address both of the above problems using "script arrays".
Instead of hard-coding the tests array structure, for each test
produce a C array of actions of the form "thread X in process Y do Z"
where Z can be calling a function, or creating a new thread or
process.


simsym
======

Use a custom AST representation.  Simsym's wrappers are currently
"thin".  They're a single object that directly wraps a Z3 AST.  This
has several downsides.  Instead, we should introduce our own AST
representation that we can convert to and from Z3 ASTs as needed.

* Because of the limitations of our representation, we often mix and
  match representations in confusing ways.  This would help us
  standardize on one representation.

  * For example, there are three ways to represent a concrete value:
    as a Python value, as a Z3 AST, and as a simsym Symbolic wrapping
    a Z3 AST.  With a more complete abstraction, we could make
    concrete values always be Python values and symbolic values always
    be simsym values.  For synonym types, this might mean introducing
    two subclasses -- one subclassing the Python concrete type and the
    other the symbolic type -- but the user should always go through
    the symbolic type's interface, and it may return a Python type.

* There are several places where we have to go from a Z3 AST to a
  simsym value.  These are always messy, ad hoc, and possibly wrong.
  With our own AST, we could do this right in one place and reap the
  benefits everywhere.

* Z3 ASTs can't directly represent simsym's compound values.  Because
  simsym's wrappers are thin, we have to convert these to a
  Z3-compatible representation eagerly, which results in strange
  expressions that expose simsym's internal details.  With our own
  ASTs, we could keep these in their original form and convert Z3 ASTs
  back to their expected form.

* Z3 ASTs aren't serializable.  It would be useful to write ASTs
  faithfully to files like the model file.  Serializable ASTs would
  also make it possible to parallelize symbolic execution.

* There are many things that are just annoying about Z3's interface
  that we could address with a thicker abstraction.  For example, many
  operations fail when given all concrete values.

* If we separate the notion of a symbolic value from an AST, we could
  handle hashing and equality much better.  The symbolic value would
  overload all of the operators, including equality to produce an
  equality expression, but would disallow hashing.  The value would be
  backed by an AST.  The AST would allow generic traversal and
  construction, and would act like a regular Python value, where
  equality would mean syntactic expression equivalence and hashing
  would hash the expression.

  * The AST would keep track of its type and would be responsible for
    computing the correct type when an operator is applied to sub-ASTs
    (to allow for generic construction of ASTs).

  * With a little metaprogramming, the AST implementation could be
    quite simple.  For example, the AST operator could be the name of
    the Python method for that operator (or perhaps the name of the
    function in the operator module?).  This would make it easy to
    convert to Z3 ASTs.


viewer
======

When viewing a test case, also show the generated test code.  That
might make the data too large to load all at once, though I could
split up the testgen data and load parts of it on demand.

Support a code entry box for specifying the interactive operator flow.

Click on a path or test ID to pop up a new window filtered to just
that path or test ID (but removing other filters).  For example, when
looking at non-idempotent cases, I often wanted to see related
idempotent cases.

In the table operator, support sorting by column.

Additional interactive operators

* Javascript query box - Interactively enter a LINQ query.  This could
  be either a simple predicate for filtering, or a general LINQ query
  (which could do joins, etc).

* Call grid([`aggregate`]) - Heatmap-like grid display, but simply
  show the result of `aggregate` in each cell (which defaults to
  count).  Useful for viewing idempotence and deltas.

* Faceted search filter

Implement a differential visualizer to show what cases are now
scalable or now non-scalable because of a change (or between two
cases).  In a call grid display, show "+N -N" boxes.  This might be
limited to two runs of the same test code, since there's no good way
to match up tests between two spec runs.


misc
====

Incremental JSON output would be mighty convenient for debugging and
development.
